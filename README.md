Cookie Clicker Bot using Selenium

This project is a simple Python automation script that plays the Cookie Clicker game using Selenium WebDriver. The bot automatically clicks the main cookie and periodically buys the most expensive upgrade it can afford.

The purpose of this project is to practice browser automation and understand how to interact with dynamic web pages using Python.
